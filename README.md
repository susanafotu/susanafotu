I currently work at [Dutchie](https://dutchie.com/careers), contributing to our B2B operations and leading our Pride Employee Resource Group. Previously, I worked at [Target](https://www.target.com/redcard/about) 🎯 on their digital experience and design system. I also acted as a pillar-lead for the [Hispanic Latino Business Council](https://corporate.target.com/sustainability-ESG/diversity-equity-inclusion/team-members-guests/hispanic-latino).
