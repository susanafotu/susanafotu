# 👋 Hi there, I'm Susana 
👂 _soo - SAH - nah_ <br>
🧚‍♀️ she/her 

I currently work at [Dutchie](https://dutchie.com/careers), where I am the Engineering Manager over a team of 6 building out Dutchie's Media Network. Previously I was a senior software engineer and helped build and improve our Ecommerce system. <br><br> As one of three co-leads for Dutchie's Pride Employee Resource Group, I have experience fostering community and a sense of belong through company wide educational programming and events. In a past life, I worked at [Target](https://www.target.com/redcard/about) 🎯 as a Senior Front End Engineer on their digital experience and design system. I spent my free time as a pillar-lead for the [Hispanic Latino Business Council](https://corporate.target.com/sustainability-ESG/diversity-equity-inclusion/team-members-guests/hispanic-latino).
