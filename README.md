# 👋 Hi there, I'm Susana 
👂 _soo - SAW - nah_ <br>
🧚‍♀️ she/her 

I currently work at [Rewiring America](https://rewiringamerica.org/), where I am Engineering Manager for the [Community Marketplace](https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/) team and provide technical leadership on Rewiring's [main site](rewiringamerica.org). Previously, I worked at [Dutchie](https://dutchie.com/careers), where I was the EM for the team building out Dutchie's Media Network. Prior to that, I was a senior software engineer who built and improved Dutchie's Ecommerce system. <br><br> I am a strong advocate for fostering a sense of community and belonging within the workplace. As one of three co-leads for Dutchie's Pride Employee Resource Group, I organized company wide educational programming and events. In a past life, I worked at [Target](https://www.target.com/redcard/about) 🎯 as a Senior Front End Engineer on their digital experience and design system. I spent my free time as a pillar-lead for the [Hispanic Latino Business Council](https://corporate.target.com/sustainability-ESG/diversity-equity-inclusion/team-members-guests/hispanic-latino).
